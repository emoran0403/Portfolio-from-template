      ideas into smaller ones, then translated those small ideas into pseudocode, which lent itself nicely to
      actual code.`,
        `Redux and MongoDB were not part of the coursework, so implementing these were initially a challenge. To
      familiarize myself with Redux, I built a small app to update multiple slices of state in different ways
      to mimic the functionality of the final project with a much simpler implementation. Once the small app
      was complete, I expanded upon it as a framework and added in new features and functionality.`,
        `I wanted to make Idlescape as close to Runescape as I could, which meant using large amounts of varied
      data available on their wiki. I did not want to copy and paste everything manually, so I made some web
      scraping utility tools. My bookmarklets scraped a wiki page for the data I was looking for, such as
      quest data, monster information, etc., and logged it to the console in the form of an object. This
      vastly reduced the workload and simplified the workflow.`,

      Document.get("ExactlyWhatIAmLookingFor").`,

      playing whack-a-mole with the debugging process: something would come up, I would check the docs to fix
      it, something new would come up that the first docs didn't warn about, and I would have to check the
      docs again.`,
        `Trying to deploy Gundam Getter was definitely the most frustrating part of the project. Every issue I
      had to address to get the project working locally came up again in a slightly different way in
      deployment. The build process on Heroku ran out of available memory and would not build - I had to
      convert it to a NextJS app to address this. Selenium required an older Heroku stack to run on. Firefox's
      binaries for Selenium had to be added to the project files itself since it wouldn't be running from my
      machine. Google APIs required a few additional steps the docs didn't really warn about.`,
